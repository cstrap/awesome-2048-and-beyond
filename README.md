# 2048 and beyond
> Play and waste your time! :-)

Waste and lose at least 8 hours of your life... then **multiply** it... ;-)

[Gabriele Cirulli](https://twitter.com/gabrielecirulli) started a revolution with his dead simple game: 2048. The code is released under the MIT license, and you are free to **hack it**. But if all the hours you spent playing the game were not enought, here is something for you.

## xkcd mentions
- [Digits](http://xkcd.com/1344/)  2048 is so popular that Randall Munroe created a stripe for it.
